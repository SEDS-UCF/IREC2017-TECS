This repo contains all the versions of the TECS we could find from last year's project. There are several branches, containing different versions of the code.

`drive` contains the latest version on the Google Drive. `servos` contains the code that was modified to actuate servos instead of a relay. `master` was the last flight-ready version before the CATO.
